# Procedural Geometry

**Introduction**
---
>What is geometry?

* Geometry is a fancy way of saying shape. In computer graphics, geometry is typically represented by an array of positions called "vertices". 
> What is a Mesh?
* A Mesh is composed of one or more surfaces. A surface is an array composed of multiple sub-arrays containing vertices, normals, UVs, etc. 
* Normally the process of constructing surfaces and meshes is hidden from the user in the VisualServer, but with ArrayMeshes, the user can construct a Mesh manually by passing in an array containing the surface information.
